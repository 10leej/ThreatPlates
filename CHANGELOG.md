10.2.0-Beta4
------------------------------------------------------
* Added basic support for WoW TBC Classic.
* Custom styles for nameplates are now automatically migrated to the new format. Unmodified legacy custom styles are removed as part of this migration. To add them back either use the command "/tptp legacy-custom-styles" or import them from here https://github.com/Backupiseasy/ThreatPlates/wiki/Custom-Styles-for-Nameplates.
* Added a new type of custom style for nameplates "Script" that allows you to extend the functionality of Threat Plates with custom Lua scripts.
