# 10.2.1 (2021-05-24)

* Fixed a bug with delayed health update in the TBC Classic Version because of a change in how health update events were processed [Comment TBC#742, #5992, Issue #490].
* Fixed a bug with crowd-control auras being shown as debuff (e.g., with wrong size) [Comment #5589, TBC#744].

# 10.2.0 (2021-05-18)
* Added basic support for WoW TBC Classic.
* Custom styles for nameplates are now automatically migrated to the new format. Unmodified legacy custom styles are removed as part of this migration. To add them back either use the command "/tptp legacy-custom-styles" or import them from here https://github.com/Backupiseasy/ThreatPlates/wiki/Custom-Styles-for-Nameplates.
* Added support for game-type specific TOC files.
