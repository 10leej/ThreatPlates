* Added options to configure in detail when to show the threat value (e.g., when a pet is active) [Comment #6154, Issue #536]. 
* Fixed a bug where players or non-totem player-controlled units were shown as totems if their name was the same as a player totem's name [Comment #6146].
* Fixed a bug where changing the colum and row limits of aura areas only took effect after reloading the UI [Comment #6169].
