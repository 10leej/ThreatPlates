# @project-version@ (@build-time@)

* Added a feature to change the name font of Blizzard nameplates and hide the healthbar (to only show unit names), e.g., while in instances.
* Added an option to show title and realm in a player's name [Comment #3952, #1995, #4164, #6140, TPC#496, Issue #312, #432].
* Added an option to show target of target with or without enclosing brackets [Issue #543, IM].
