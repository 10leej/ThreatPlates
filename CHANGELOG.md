* Added a feature to change the name font of Blizzard nameplates and hide the healthbar (to only show unit names), e.g., while in instances.
* Integrated new UNIT_AURA processing optimizations to improve unit aura processing in encounters where many nameplates are on screen at once [Comment #6114].
