**  8.1 (works with [[https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/tidy-plates|Tidy Plates 6.18.3]])**
------------------------------------------------------
  * Updates for 7.0.3: Added demonhunter class, updated spell lists (including shaman totems), updated dual spec options, and a lot of bug fixes
  * ++Implemented a new feature: Headline View (Text-Only) as known from TidyPlates - TidyPlatesHub must be enabled for this to work; configure it via TidyPlatesHub profiles++
  * ++Added basic configuration options for Headline View (Name-Only), see Nameplate Settings - Headline View (subtext settings are derived from nametext settings)++
  * In Headline-View mode, all Threat Plate widgets are now disabled (auras, combo points, ...) - doesn't make much sense enabling them in this mode
  * ++Implemented a new feature to enable automatic role detection based on the currently active spec (see options, Threat System, Spec Roles)++
  * Castbar border can now be set to Default or Thin (like healthbar border)
  * Improverd layering of Threat Plates widgets and target name plate (which is often overlapped by other plates)
  * Removed no longer supported localizations (translation support is welcome!)
  * Fixed a bug where certain nameplate widgets were not updated after changes in the options dialog
	* Fixed error with reload UI and AuraWidget
	* Fixed HP bar colouring with NPCs
