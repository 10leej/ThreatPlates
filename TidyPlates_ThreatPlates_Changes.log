------------------------------------------------------
8.006-Alpha (works with  TidyPlates 6.18.Beta20)
------------------------------------------------------
  * Fixed a bug where certain nameplate widgets were not updated after changes in the options dialog (TidyPlates removed ReloadTheme() function)
  * Added a config option to set the alpha level of headline view nameplates (see About pane in the options dialog)

------------------------------------------------------
8.005-Alpha (works with  TidyPlates 6.18.Beta20)
------------------------------------------------------
  * Fixed a bug with the target aura widgets's strata (was sometimes shown behind other nameplates/auras) - rather a nasty fix for the time being (as TidyPlates layering is reworked currently)

------------------------------------------------------
8.004-Alpha (works with  TidyPlates 6.18.Beta20)
------------------------------------------------------
  * Implemented a new alpha feature (see About dialog): Headline View (Text-Only) as known from TidyPlates - TidyPlatesHub must be enabled for this to work; configure it via TidyPlatesHub profiles
	* Added four missing PVP totems (no totems should be missing now) and switched to  different colors for totem types (e.g.  PvP, Talents, ...)
	* Added transparent class icon for Demonhunter and special icons (red glowing border) for totem icons
  * Added an option to disable the cooldown spiral on auras (requires reload UI)
  * Castbar border can now be set to Default or Thin (like healthbar border)
  * Known issues:
    - Localization not updated except en and de, although no errors should occur
    - Configuring specs could be done completely in TidyPlates - dialog in ThreadPlates in no longer necessary
    - Reload UI necessary for certain options in the options

------------------------------------------------------
8.003-Alpha (works with  TidyPlates 6.18.Beta11)
------------------------------------------------------
	* Fixed error with reload UI and AuraWidget
	* Fixed problem with TidyPlatesHub overwritting AuraWidget settings of ThreatPlates
	* Known issues:
		- Changing aura style needs a reload UI to work (was so before)
		- Localization not updated except en and de
		- Styles for icons (special/transparent) are not working (no graphics guru :})


------------------------------------------------------
8.002-Alpha
------------------------------------------------------
	* Added demonhunter class  (icons, tank tag)
	* Updated shaman totem list (icons and IDs) and rogue spell Anticipation
	* Fixed HP bar colouring with NPCs (probably still buggy)
	* Adjusted dual spec to new model in Legion
	* Changed spec option dialog to show actual  spec names for configuration
	* Known issues:
		- Localization not updated except en and de
		- Styles for icons (special/transparent) are not working (no graphics guru :})

In Progress
------------------------------------------------------
* Optimize code for thema change (by TidyPlates)
* Changing aura style should not need reload UI to work (unchanged, was always that way)
