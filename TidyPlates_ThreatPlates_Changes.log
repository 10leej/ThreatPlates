------------------------------------------------------
8.011-Beta (works with TidyPlates 6.18.2)
------------------------------------------------------
  * Updated localizations (en, de)

------------------------------------------------------
8.010-Beta (works with TidyPlates 6.18.2)
------------------------------------------------------
  * Added basic configuration options for Headline View (Name-Only), see Nameplate Settings - Headline View (subtext settings are derived from nametext settings)

------------------------------------------------------
8.009-Beta (works with TidyPlates 6.18.2)
------------------------------------------------------
  * Improverd layering of Threat Plates widgets (not all though) and target name plate (which is often overlapped by other plates)
  * In Headline-View mode, all Threat Plate widgets are now disabled (auras, combo points, ...) - doesn't make much sense enabling them in this mode

------------------------------------------------------
8.008-Beta (works with TidyPlates 6.18.2)
------------------------------------------------------
  * Disabled cooldown spiral option (enable/disable) as the feature was removed from TidyPlates in 6.18.2

------------------------------------------------------
8.007-Beta (works with TidyPlates 6.18.Beta21)
------------------------------------------------------
  * This is the first beta version for 8.100 - no new features will be implemented until this release, just bug fixes
  * Implemented a new feature to enable automatic role detection based on the currently active spec (see options, Threat System, Spec Roles)
  * Removed no longer supported localizations (translation support is welcome!)

------------------------------------------------------
8.006-Alpha (works with TidyPlates 6.18.Beta20)
------------------------------------------------------
  * Added a config option to set the alpha level of headline view nameplates (see About pane in the options dialog)
  * Fixed a bug where certain nameplate widgets were not updated after changes in the options dialog (TidyPlates removed ReloadTheme() function)
  * Fixed a nil error with healer tracker widget because of missing auras (introduced with 8.005-Alpha)

------------------------------------------------------
8.005-Alpha (works with TidyPlates 6.18.Beta20)
------------------------------------------------------
  * Fixed a bug with the target aura widgets's strata (was sometimes shown behind other nameplates/auras) - rather a nasty fix for the time being (as TidyPlates layering is reworked currently)

------------------------------------------------------
8.004-Alpha (works with TidyPlates 6.18.Beta20)
------------------------------------------------------
  * Implemented a new alpha feature (see About dialog): Headline View (Text-Only) as known from TidyPlates - TidyPlatesHub must be enabled for this to work; configure it via TidyPlatesHub profiles
	* Added four missing PVP totems (no totems should be missing now) and switched to  different colors for totem types (e.g.  PvP, Talents, ...)
	* Added transparent class icon for Demonhunter and special icons (red glowing border) for totem icons
  * Added an option to disable the cooldown spiral on auras (requires reload UI)
  * Castbar border can now be set to Default or Thin (like healthbar border)

------------------------------------------------------
8.003-Alpha (works with TidyPlates 6.18.Beta11)
------------------------------------------------------
	* Fixed error with reload UI and AuraWidget
	* Fixed problem with TidyPlatesHub overwritting AuraWidget settings of ThreatPlates

------------------------------------------------------
8.002-Alpha
------------------------------------------------------
	* Added demonhunter class  (icons, tank tag)
	* Updated shaman totem list (icons and IDs) and rogue spell Anticipation
	* Fixed HP bar colouring with NPCs (probably still buggy)
	* Adjusted dual spec to new model in Legion
	* Changed spec option dialog to show actual  spec names for configuration
