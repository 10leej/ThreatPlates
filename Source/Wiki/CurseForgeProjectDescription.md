***Threat Plates*** (TP for short) is an addon for customizing your nameplates. It offers a high amount of customization
and tweaks to how your nameplates react and look. I've spent a considerable amount of time improving this addon and any
comments or concerns about this addon are appreciated. I'm always looking for ways to improve it.

***Features***

* All the ***standard nameplate features*** like healthbar, name, castbar, coloring (e.g., based on threat), scaling and transparency and so on.
* Two different modes for nameplates: ***Healthbar View*** (show healthbar and name) and ***Headline View*** (show only name)
* ***Customizable totem*** nameplates
* ***Custom styles for nameplates*** for extra customization for units based on name, auras or casts.
* ***Automatic spec detection*** and role assigning for an easy out of the box setup
* Support for ***profiles per spec***
* Support for LibSharedMedia (adding additional fonts, textures and sounds) and LibDogTag (markup language support for custom texts)
* And lots of options...

***Chat Commands***

* ***/tptp***: Displays options
* ***/tptp profile &lt;name&gt;***: Switch the current profile to &lt;name&gt;
* ***/tptp legacy-custom-styles***: Adds (legacy) default custom styles for nameplates that are deleted when migrating

***Version for WoW Classic***

A port of Threat Plates for WoW Classic is available
here: [Threat Plates (Classic)](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/threat-plates-classic).

***Scripting (Beta)***

Scripting is a new feature of Threat Plates that will be introduced in a future version. It allows you to extend the
functionality with custom Lua scripts. Once the feature is finished, you should be able to change all aspects of
nameplates. Currently, functionality is still restricted to a high degree as internal functions of Threat Plates (
like, e.g., scaling) are not easily accessible to these scripts. So, overwriting or changing them to, e.g., implement custom
scaling is not that easy or may even be impossible right now.

More details as well as the current beta version are
available [here](https://github.com/Backupiseasy/ThreatPlates/wiki/Scripting-Custom-Styles).
